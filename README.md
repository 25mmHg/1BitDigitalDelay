# 1BitDigitalDelay
Delay for Trigger
For researches about synchronisation we need an delay for drum triggering with 1ms resolution and delays of 10seconds ore more.
This is the first working example of our researches.
TODO:
substitute the 512x4Byte Ringbuffer to 1024x2Byte (handle overflow from 50days to 1minute)
better debounce of INPUT (max input frequency is now 5Hz)
